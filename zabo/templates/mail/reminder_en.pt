Dear ${name}

We are really pleased to see you signed up for our Sustain campaign on
${date}  However, until now we have not received a related
transfer from you. That is why now we would just like to politely ask you 
whether you are still inclined to chip in.
 
Shouldn't that be the case, you don't have to bother at all: We'll simply 
remove your data from our database in case you do not reply and get back to us 
during the next few days. But should you still want to support us with a 
remittance order, a short notice via mail is all it takes.
 
We are happy to answer your questions in case you have difficulties with
the procedure. And maybe there is a misunderstanding as Sustain is not
using a direct debiting scheme. To take part in the program, you make a 
remittance order and transfer money to us periodically -- as much and as long, 
as you like.

What ever your decision may be: Thank You for your interest in the C3S!


Best :: Your C3S
